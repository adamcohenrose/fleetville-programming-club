I started running a lunchtime programming club at Fleetville Junior School for a bunch of kids in year 4 (8-9 years old) in February 2012.

Following the excellent example of [Mark Chapman](https://github.com/mchapman/WebDevKeyStage2), I updated this repo with lesson plans and some feedback on how the lessons went.

Shortly after I started the sessions, <http://codeclub.org.uk> started and we adopted [their excellent projects](https://github.com/CodeClub/scratch-curriculum).

We finished the Code Club Scratch projects a while ago. Rather than moving on to the HTML and Python projects, we experimented with LEGO Robots and Codecademy Javascript and eventually ended up with [MinecraftEdu](http://minecraftedu.com/).

Now aged 11, the children who started this course are working their way through the [Land of Turtles](http://services.minecraftedu.com/worlds/node/42), using Minecraft and ComputerCraft to instruct virtual turtles to dig, build and navigate around the Minecraft landscape.
