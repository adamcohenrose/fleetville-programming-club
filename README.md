I am running a lunchtime programming club at Fleetville Junior School for a bunch of kids in year 4 (8-9 years old).

Following the excellent example of [Mark Chapman](https://github.com/mchapman/WebDevKeyStage2), I will be keeping this repo up to date with lesson plans and some feedback on how the lessons went.

The lessons will start by exploring Scratch and we'll see how we go from there...
