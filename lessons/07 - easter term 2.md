# lesson 7

In the previous session, one pair of kids had started a Maze game, and the other a Scenes animation. I wanted to rotate the pairs so that the pair who had worked on the Move the Turtle iPad game were able to do some Scratch. I wanted to move another pair onto the iPad so that the room wasn't so busy.

I brought in the Scratch Curriculum Guide handouts and the Scratch Cards as inspiration.

Once again, the plan was to let the kids work on their projects!
