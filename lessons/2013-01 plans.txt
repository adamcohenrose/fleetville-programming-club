# Spring term 2013

## Intentions
* controlling robots
* spread code club throughout school
* puzzles, challenges (problem solving)
* sticking parts together, rather than a recipe
* collaboration
* teaching younger kids

## Ideas
* Codeclub Term Two:
	* sound machine (sound recorder) - 2-3 wks
	* frantic felix (platform game) - 2-3 wks
		* make different baddies - share them between games
		* different properties: shoots, follows you, can be killed after pill...
		* different superpowers for goodie
		* what went well with previous games?
			* something that you're proud of
			* something that you find annoying
* Mindstorms + Enchanting + Mayan Adventure
	* going through a maze
	* shy puppy
	* line follower
	* fastest round a maze (competing programs)
* Animation 13 (entries due by March 22nd)
	* need a self-running animation for 1 minute
	* tutorial on storyboards
	* try Alice? -- NO: too complicated!
* Raspberry Pi
	* Scratch + GPIO
	* robot competition with Mindstorms + Enchanting
	* won't be ready for tinkering for 2 weeks or so...
* Remote working with Hertford CodeClub?
	* Scratch networking between schools
	* remote sound machine?
* school ICT projects
* expand into school curriculum
* teaching younger kids
	* make your own Scratch cards
	* Scratch buddies

## Planning
* time available:
	* 6 weeks until half term
	* then 3 weeks (am away for 4th) until animation due
	* then 1 week until end of term
* only have one Mindstorms kit, so only one pair on Enchanting...
	* no point in installing on laptops...
	* will probably take them 1-2 sessions to do maze / shy puppy
* 3/4 weeks on animation?
	* storyboarding & story arcs
		* toontastic?
		* Rosanna
	* making sprites & backgrounds
	* adding music & sounds -- sourcing from open sound resources on the web
		* can use sound machine to introduce!

## Raspberry Pi requirements
* case to avoid sticky fingers
	* can use cassette case: <http://imgur.com/a/AZIZN#6>
	* or build a case with LEGO
* more solid breakout
	* use M/F & M/M cables?
	* 75 M/M: <http://is.gd/YAmkVa> £3.90
	* 25 F/M: <http://is.gd/HAwLS2> £3.49
