# lesson 5

A simple one here. The kids are really getting into their project, so I want to let them have some time to create.

## show and tell
* all gather round one computer while one person from each pair explains about their part of the story
  * what have they done?
  * how does it work?
  * what do they want to do next?

## demo
* see an example of another project from the Scratch community
* this week we looked at a [Roller Coaster Simulator](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/mgmir/321988)

## build more NASA rocket!
