# lesson 3

## welcome and recap
* let's see what you made at home! (2m each -- up to 10m)
* we're working in pairs again today -- I'll be swapping pairs around this time
* try to take turns on the keyboard!

## today's challenge
* George wanted to build a NASA rocket -- so that's what we'll do!
* we're going to have a story in three parts
  1. building the rocket
  2. launching the rocket
  3. flying the rocket in space
* each pair will make one of the parts of the story
* the pairs will change so you'll all get to work on two parts
* starting pairs:
  * George/Freddie
  * Max/Ethan
  * Arden/Thomas
* rotate 2nd of each pair after 10m, then 1st of each pair (the other way) after another 10m

  * enjoyable
