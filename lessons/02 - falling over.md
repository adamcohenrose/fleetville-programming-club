# lesson 2

## welcome and recap
* who got scratch running at home? (2m)
  * any who tried but failed can talk to me later
* tell us about what you made! (5-10m)
* if you want to bring your work into school, share your project in the Scratch app using Share > Share This Project Online...
* today we're going to work in pairs so you have to talk about what you're doing
* try to take turns on the keyboard!

## today's challenge
* show [demo](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/adamcohenrose/2363410)
* introduce "forever" block
* point out sprite rotation fixing buttons at the top of the scripts area

### challenge steps
1. choose a sprite (you've got 2 mins, go!)
1. get the sprite to keep on moving (it will stop when it reaches the edge anyway)
1. introduce the "if on edge, bounce" block
1. now get it to bounce when it reaches the edge
  * what happens if you forget to click the "only face left or right" button?
1. introduce "repeat until" block and "touching edge" sensor
1. can you get the sprite to fall over (change costume) and make a noise when it reaches the edge?

### bonus levels
1. can you get the sprite to get up and turn around after it has fallen over?
  * HINT: try the "point in direction" Motion block
2. what happens when it reaches the other edge?
  * HINT 1: look at the "direction" block at the bottom of the "Motion" blocks
  * HINT 2: trying looking at the "Operators" blocks -- what happens when you multiply the direction by -1?
