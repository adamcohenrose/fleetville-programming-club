# lesson 6

This was the first session after the kids returned from their Easter term. Since the previous term, more than half of the laptops in the room we use had either died or gone somewhere else.

Fortunately, I'd planned to try out [Move The Turtle](http://j.mp/move-the-turtle) -- a great Logo programming game for the iPad so I was able to get the lesson going with two pairs of kids on Scratch and the third pair on the iPad.

I also printed out some of the handouts from the [Scratch Curriculum Guide](http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-curriculum-guide-draft) to inspire the kids into creating some new projects. The ones I chose were Build-a-band, Scenes, Maze and Collide.

The plan was simply to let the kids pair up and start a new project for the new term.
