# Retrospective

## Went well
* the kids were really able to explain what they were working on -- the other pairs were excited to see what they had made and I was really impressed by the way they were all able to explain what they had made and how they had made it work
* the kids were also able to help each other when it came to thinking up what they wanted to do next and how they were going to do it -- they even suggested different blocks that other pairs could use
* I managed the timing a bit better this session -- we weren't in a terrible rush to save at the end as the next class came in
* I remembered to open the windows before we started -- the room was much fresher as a result!
* the school provided all the Scratch cards as laminated sheets which I could share out and use to get the kids thinking. As before, the kids didn't use the cards explicitly but I got the impression that they got the kids thinking about sticking programming blocks together to achieve things

## Went badly
* *nothing much -- a really good session!*

## Puzzles
* I (still) need to find a way to rotate the kids around so that different ones are doing the typing
  * one pair is working well together, but in both of the other groups it's mainly one person on the keyboard the whole time
* sometimes some kids get stuck on choosing sounds: the sound library has loads of funny clips in it that are even better when played one after another -- but when this is done by just clicking one after the other, there's no programming involved...
  * perhaps some kids would be interested in making a sound board?

## Ideas for next time
* start with a show and tell again
* get the kids to work together to come up with ideas for their next projects
* start new projects with the kids in different pairs
