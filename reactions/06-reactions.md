# Retrospective

Another really good session -- I think the kids and I are getting the hang of this :-)

## Went well
* having just two pairs of kids working on Scratch projects actually worked well -- they were at opposite ends of the (quite small) room and didn't disturb each other as much as before (Scratch coding amongst 9 year old boys is a noisy process!)
* the third pair playing Move The Turtle on the iPad enjoyed it to start with, but got stuck a little on the second chapter
* I was a little stronger in my approach to discipline -- telling the kids that if they got too boisterous then they would have to leave the club until next week (I guess this is a threat that only works when you run an optional lunch club!)
  * either this threat worked, or having just two pairs working on Scratch helped the whole session be a little calmer
* the kids naturally chose different pairs from the ones they had been in the previous term

## Went badly
* *nothing much -- a really good session!*

## Puzzles
* *nothing much -- a really good session!*

## Ideas for next time
* swap the pair working on Move the Turtle with either a whole pair doing Scratch or one from each of the other pairs
* tell the headmaster about <http://codeclub.org.uk/>
