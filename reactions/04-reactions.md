# Retrospective

## Went well
* starting with talking rather than jumping straight onto computers worked much better
* the kids find it hard to stop once they've started on the computer but were able to talk at the beginning
* the pairs were able to describe what they'd done in their NASA rocket scenes and also what they'd like to achieve

## Went badly
* still in a rush at the end of the session
* it got very hot in the room and I didn't think to open the windows... seven year 4 boys can make a room very stuffy!

## Puzzles
* I need to find a way to rotate the kids around so that different ones are doing the typing
  * one pair is working well together, but in both of the other groups it's mainly one person on the keyboard the whole time

## Ideas for next time
* start with a show and tell again
* see if I can get the work they've done at home ready for them to show
* print out multiple sets of the Scratch cards so that each group can have a selection

And here is what the kids thought about the programming club so far:

# Kids' Retrospective

## Enjoyable
* drawing sprites
* programming: especially making things explode!
* lift off of NASA rocket
* all of it!

## Frustrating
* UFO getting stuck on ship
* sprites going missing when move them too much

## Ideas for future
* baby commando
* spaceman bob's adventures
* make snakes & ladders
* baby rugby game

# Who has been able to login/download at home?
* H only has his mum's locked down computer -- can't install any software
* M hasn't downloaded or registered yet, but has a Mac so could do so easily
