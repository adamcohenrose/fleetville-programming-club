# Retrospective

## Went well
* More kids have downloaded Scratch at home -- one has made loads of projects and showed some of them to us :-)
* The kids had come prepared! I'd mentioned ideas to my son beforehand -- he'd discussed them with his friends and they had chosen pairs and which bit of the project they would work on
* They all came up with loads of creative ideas: making soundtracks, combining weird sprites, drawing great rockets and spacemen -- see their work at http://j.mp/fleetville-scratch-projects

## Went badly
* Ran out of time -- I wanted to get the kids to have a moment to discuss what they had done so far and what they thought of it, but they were too busy working on their projects!

## Puzzles
* Sometimes one child is working on writing scripts and the other in the pair is not involved -- a couple of times kids were bored for a minute or two. What can I do to help them engage with each other more during the programming bit?
* Do I need to introduce more programming ideas -- or will they just figure them out by themselves?

## Ideas for next time
* Do the retrospective at the beginning of the lesson (would be useful to see what they want to do next as well!)
* Print out more Scratch cards as ideas -- although they weren't used directly, I think just having them around provided some inspiration
