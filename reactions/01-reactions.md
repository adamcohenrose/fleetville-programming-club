The kids' reaction: awesome, fantastic, amazing!

My reaction: creative chaos! :-)

We had seven kids on laptops all excitedly trying out Scratch, all pretty much for the first time.

I tried to get them to open the Scratch help page, but they didn't really know how to switch between the two apps and were confused by the PDF (too big, too small, didn't know how to scroll).

Also there were seven different explorations going on all at the same time -- some of them drawing sprites, some importing loads of random sprites, and others recording and playing sounds (adding to the increasing noise level!).

I went round trying to persuade them to get a sprite to move using the blocks, which they did do but then wanted to go right back to drawing/recording/stamping sprites.

They *did* explore the Scratch interface and all of them managed to make a sprite move using a block, which is a great start.

I tried giving them a challenge to get a sprite to move in a rectangle, but that was too much of a stretch in the first session.

I think next week I will get them to pair up, so there's less different things going on at once -- and plan a really simple challenge with a demonstration first to see if they can do it.

Hopefully some of them will try out Scratch at home during the week, so we can spend some of the session talking about or seeing what they've made at home.
