# Retrospective

Definitely getting the hang of this :-)

The kids that had worked on Move the Turtle wanted to do a Scratch project, and fortunately the last two kids to arrive were a pair who were happy to switch to the iPad.

Once again, having two pairs doing Scratch projects and one pair on the iPad worked well. One pair finished their Maze game (see it at <http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/bogzug/2477414>) and the other made a good start on a Scenes animation.

The pair on the iPad really got into it and started exploring beyond the exercises -- getting the turtle to do crazy things just for fun!

I met up with the headmaster after the class and he was really impressed with what the kids had made. I told him about <http://codeclub.org.uk/> and he was very positive.

I think the club is getting to the point where I could send the kids out to teach their friends -- but I'm not sure how to expand it without the sessions getting out of control.

A couple of other technical people at work have said they're interested in helping out -- so perhaps getting them to come along would be a way to manage a larger group. I think we'd need a larger room as well, though...
