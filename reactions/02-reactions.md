# Retrospective

## Went well
* Pairing worked, but need to rotate pairs halfway through
* The kids all completed the exercise
  * They even used the "if on edge, bounce" block to avoid doing the calculation in the bonus level!

## Went badly
* Couldn't show online scratch projects -- Java had problems on school laptops
* Couldn't upload scratch projects -- problems connecting!
  * We fixed this after the lesson by changing the scratch INI file to specify the school's proxy
* One laptop didn't have sound -- neither microphone nor speaker worked

## Puzzles
* Why can't some of the kids download Scratch at home?
  * According to the kids, there may be some additional required software on Windows...?

## Ideas for next time
* One of the boys wants to build a NASA space rocket!
  * Find an exercise that involves a rocket...
* Rotate pairs halfway through -- get the kids to talk for a few minutes about what they've done so far
* Try a retrospective with the kids!
* Startup check for each laptop:
  * Does it have Scratch installed?
  * Does it have sound?
